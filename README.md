# HtmlParser
CrawlerCommon is the Html Parser library.  
CrawlerHpathUI is a sample UI of how to extract data using it.  
CrawlerCommonVisualDiagnostic is a tool used to diagnose any bugs encountered in parsing a HTML document.  
CrawlerCommonTest is a unit test project that is showing a lot of errors.  
  I obviously didn't complete every feature as planned.
  It worked enough for my use case, and I stopped working on it.  This has been what it does for me
  
IT ISN'T PERFECT b/c I just fix enough bugs, for it to serve my needs.  
I THINK IT IS AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO START, if you want to figure out how to parse HTML yourself.
  
    It has parsed Fantasy Football stats
    It has parsed Football schedules
    It has parsed Google Searches.
